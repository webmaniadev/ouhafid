About
============
Sometimes in business, we need to create a direct invoice based on the delivery order. This module creates invoice from delivery order when validating delivery order. If you activate the "send invoice email when delivery validates" option then it auto sends invoices by email when you validate the delivery order.



Installation
============
1) Copy module files to addon folder.
2) Restart odoo service (sudo service odoo-server restart).
3) Go to your odoo instance and open apps (make sure to activate debug mode).
4) click on update app list.
5) search module name and hit install button.
